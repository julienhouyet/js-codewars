# JavaScript – CodeWars Practice

This repository contains JavaScript exercises solved on CodeWars.

## Goal

- Practice JavaScript fundamentals
- Improve problem-solving skills

## Structure

- Exercises are grouped by difficulty level (kyu)
- One exercise per file
- Solutions are written for clarity, not optimization

## Learning process

For each exercise:

1. I solve the problem on my own first.
2. Then I review alternative solutions on CodeWars.
3. I keep the clearest version that I fully understand and can rewrite from memory.

> I prefer showing what I can explain confidently rather than keeping every draft attempt.

## Naming conventions

- Files use snake_case (e.g. `even_or_odd.js`)
- One file = one kata
